        <p>The Flyknit Racer line comes from a technology developed by Nike in February 2012 and is used throughout their training, running, soccer, basketball, and lifestyle releases. The featherweight, formfitting material is not only comfortable on your feet, but has contributed a significant reduction in manufacturing waste. This special 'BETRUE' edition was released in 2017 in support of the LGBTQ community.</p>

        <p>The Kobe A.D. is Kobe Bryant's twelfth signature shoe and the first sneaker to release after Kobe's retirement from the NBA in 2016. Featuring a mix of Flywire, mesh, Lunarlon, and Zoom Air, the Kobe A.D. is often said to be one of Kobe's best basketball shoes yet, albeit taking some time to break in properly to achieve maximum performance and comfort on the court.</p>
